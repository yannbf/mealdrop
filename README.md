## Chromatic E2E Visual Tests Demo (with Playwright)

Showcases Chromatic's [E2E Visual Tests](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/e2e-visual-tests/) in a real-world setting. We use the [MealDrop](https://mealdrop.vercel.app/) app as an example of how to catch visual regressions as part of our E2E testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
